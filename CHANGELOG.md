# Changelog

## [1.2.3] - 2026-05-03

### Changed

- Upload video files as Telegram media documents with streaming enabled instead of forcing them to generic file attachments.
- Upload audio files as playable Telegram audio media while keeping other file types as regular drive files.

---

## [1.2.2] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed

- Fixed image preview rendering after the large-photo optimization by enabling Tauri's asset protocol for app cache files and allowing the local asset host in the image CSP.

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-02

### Performance

- Optimized large image folders by loading Telegram thumbnail media instead of downloading full image files for grid thumbnails.
- Changed thumbnail and preview rendering to use cached local file paths instead of base64 data URLs, reducing memory pressure and CPU work.
- Added frontend thumbnail request throttling and duplicate-request sharing so only a small number of thumbnails load at once.
- Limited preview prefetch to small images and removed card layout animation that caused extra reflow in large grids.

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- Added a Telegram multi-account switcher. The app now keeps separate local session files per saved account, supports adding another account from the sidebar, and can switch/remove saved accounts without deleting Telegram files.
- Moved workspace state into account-specific stores so folders, tags, queues, local sync settings, Google Drive settings, and activity history stay separated per Telegram account.

---

## [1.1.6] - 2026-04-28

### Fix

- Fixed process not terminating on Ctrl+C (SIGINT) when launched from a terminal.
  The Actix-web streaming server and grammers network runner were running on
  non-daemon threads with no shutdown signal wired to process exit, causing the
  application to hang indefinitely after the main window closed. The app now
  registers a RunEvent::Exit handler that gracefully stops both background
  services before the process exits.

---

## [1.1.5] - 2026-04-27

### Hotfix

- **CI fix: AppImage patch step now runs cleanly** — Replaced the fragile `grep -oP` Perl lookahead (which exited with code 2 under `set -euo pipefail`) with a safe `awk`-based `.desktop` file lookup. Added `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1` so `appimagetool` doesn't require the FUSE kernel module on GitHub Actions runners.

---

## [1.1.4] - 2026-04-27

### Hotfix

- **Deeper AppImage EGL fix for Arch/rolling-release Linux** — Added a CI post-build patching step that strips the Ubuntu-bundled `libEGL`, `libGL`, `libGLdispatch`, `libGLX`, and `libGLESv2` from the AppImage squashfs and replaces the `AppRun` wrapper with one that: normalises the locale to `C.UTF-8`, sets `NO_AT_BRIDGE=1` to silence ATK warnings, auto-detects `EGL_PLATFORM` from `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY`/`$DISPLAY`, points GLVND at the system ICD vendor dirs, preloads the system `libEGL.so.1`, and orders `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so host GPU drivers are always resolved before bundled stubs.

---

## [1.1.3] - 2026-04-27

### Hotfix

- **Fixed Arch Linux AppImage crash** — Resolved `EGL_BAD_ALLOC` error on Arch Linux (and other rolling-release distros) caused by bundled Mesa/EGL libraries conflicting with the host GPU driver stack. The app now automatically disables WebKitGTK's DMA-BUF renderer on Linux before the WebView initializes, with no impact to Windows or macOS builds.

---

## [1.0.4] - 2026-02-13

### Fixes

- Finally squashed the grid overlap bug for real. Cards were using CSS `aspect-[4/3]` to size themselves, but the virtualizer was computing row heights separately — at certain window widths these disagreed and rows would bleed into each other. Now both use the same explicit pixel height, so no more overlap regardless of how you resize the window.

### Cleanup

- Went through the whole codebase and ripped out every `console.log` / `console.error` we'd left in from debugging (16 of them). The one in `ErrorBoundary` stays since that's the whole point of an error boundary.
- Got rid of all `as any` casts on the frontend — everything's properly typed now.
- Ran Clippy and fixed all 7 warnings, including a couple of `collapsible_match` ones in `fs.rs` that needed manual refactoring.
- Dropped `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, and `@tauri-apps/plugin-opener` from `package.json` — none of them were actually imported anywhere.
- General comment cleanup throughout.
